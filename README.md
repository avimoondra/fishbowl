# https://fishbowl-game.com

Play the Fishbowl game online! Also known as Salad bowl, Monikers, or Celebrities. It's a free, virtual version of a fun (and mostly hilarious) guessing game, designed for any group of all ages! You'll need at least 4 to play, but it only gets more fun with more players. Hop on a video call, and play through rounds of Taboo, Charades, and Password.

# Technology

Fishbowl is built with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/), [Hasura](https://hasura.io/), and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/). It's deployed on [Render](https://render.com/).
